## About
Easymeals is a simple web app I made using [VueJS](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss). It allows for you to simply view a list of recipes. The recipes are provided by means of [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php). You can also favorite recipes, and view your favorites later on by clicking on the favorites button in the bottom right.

The design was made using Adobe XD. You can download the design [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g0uhqqd84b9br9o/easyMeals.xd?dl=0).
